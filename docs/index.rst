Forwoard-mode automatic differentiation
=============================================
In this documentation, the package **dual_autodiff** and its optimised Cython version **dual_autodiff_cy** are introduced. We will learn
how to use the packages and then use them to perform an accurate, stable and fast method for differentiation. However, the function being 
derived can only consist of defined operations. (See tutorial)
